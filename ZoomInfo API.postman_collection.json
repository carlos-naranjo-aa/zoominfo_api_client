		"description": "Welcome to ZoomInfo's API. ZoomInfo is the leading data intelligence platform for B2B go-to-market teams, presenting a trifecta of the broadest, deepest and highest quality B2B data.\n\nUse the API to query the ZoomInfo database for relevant companies and contacts and enrich the data records in your Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Marketing Automation (MA), and other systems in your organization. The API helps you build out your organization's contact and company records by tapping in-depth information such as technologies used, company attributes, corporate hierarchies, funding details, news alerts and scoops, and more. This deep data enables teams to build sophisticated, refined, and targeted prospect segments, as well as improve campaign list building, prospecting, lead routing, scoring, and territory alignment.\n\n# API structure\n\nThe ZoomInfo API is a set of HTTPS endpoints you can use to programmatically retrieve and integrate ZoomInfo data into your existing technology stack and workflows. Responses are returned in JSON to support integration with common programming languages and development kits.\n\nThe Enterprise API supports searching for and enriching company and contact records, and are comprised as follows:\n\n**Standard APIs**\n\n- The [Search API](#20219386-4c34-485e-a859-c697d64f2ae9) accepts various input criteria which are used to return Contacts, Companies, Scoops, News and Intent records. The purpose of Search is to cast a wide net, returning a list of records that meet the input criteria. The records returned are previews of the full ZoomInfo profile. Use the Enrich API endpoints to return ZoomInfo's full profile for any record.\n    \n- The [Enrich API](#4c495fb6-68df-44bb-8703-0616f81cfdcb) is used to retrieve ZoomInfo's full profile data by matching to known contacts or companies. Use the Enrich endpoints to redeem full profiles returned from Search queries, or enrich your existing database of contacts and companies with ZoomInfo data.\n    \n- The [Lookup API](#efe7b4b8-1ef2-4fcd-a20f-9da68f6b2055) includes a set of endpoints that return available inputs and outputs for corresponding Search or Enrich requests. Use the Input Lookup endpoints to help select the input criteria supported by the different requests. The Lookup Output endpoints provide a full list of fields returned by each endpoint.\n    \n- The [Usage API](#ec3704c0-8898-4ba7-baf4-c45b46ef80d3) lets you check your current API usage and limits.\n    \n\n**Scaling APIs**\n\n- The [Webhooks API](#0a3012d3-546c-45bd-9a3c-d014b93ce47e) is a set of endpoints that lets you configure webhooks subscriptions to automate the update of records - listening for events you subscribe to, and sending updates securely to your application.\n    \n- The [Bulk API](#00c2d0c8-d0f6-4904-a5b1-495675e13189) is a set of endpoints that provide bulk search and redeem capabilities for Contacts and Companies, enabling the search and retrieval of large ZoomInfo Company and Contact datasets at scale through asynchronous batch processes.\n    \n\n**WebSights API**\n\nThe [WebSights API](#9e5ec7b8-5cef-40ee-86f3-105be2194fe7) identifies anonymous website traffic by resolving IP addresses to return company and ISP profiles and IP Geolocation details.\n\n**Compliance API**\n\nThe [Compliance API](#8631bd5c-4435-4fb4-9d4f-91b73cf7e89e) includes endpoints related to data privacy and opt-out compliance for contacts stored in the ZoomInfo database.\n\n# Authentication methods\n\nThe API supports the following authentication methods:\n\n- Private Key Infrastructure (PKI)\n    \n- Username and password\n    \n\nFor both authentication methods, a Java Web Token (JWT) is returned which can be programmatically or manually used to access the API.\n\n## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication\n\nThe preferred authentication method is to obtain a Client ID and Private key pair and a public library to programmatically generate a JWT that is valid for one hour. To do this:\n\n1. Log in to the ZoomInfo GUI using admin credentials with API access.\n    \n2. Go to **Admin Portal** > **API** and click **Generate New Key**. You are provided with a Client ID and a Private Key.\n    \n3. Import a public library that authenticates using this Client ID and Private Key and generates a JWT.\n    \n\nZoomInfo provides supported PKI authentication libraries for Java, Python and NodeJS in [Github](https://github.com/Zoominfo).\n\n## Username and password authentication\n\nYou can use the [Authentication endpoint](#ea1ebd5d-8b4a-412f-a8c8-3d8b8e123407) to manually supply your username and password, returning a JWT that is valid for one hour.\n\nA developer can alternatively import a public library that authenticates a username and password to return a JWT. ZoomInfo provides supported username and password authentication libraries for Java, Python and NodeJS in [Github](https://github.com/Zoominfo).\n\n# Rate and usage limits\n\nThe ZoomInfo API uses rate and usage limits tied to the account provisioned for API access. Your API account is provisioned with:\n\n- **Rate limits**: A limit to the number of requests you can make within a given time period.\n    \n    - For the Authentication endpoint, the limit is 1 request per second.\n        \n    - For the Standard APIs, WebSights API, and Compliance API, the limit is 25 requests per second (1500 request per minute).\n        \n    - For the Scaling APIs, the limit is 33 requests per second (2000 requests per minute)\n        \n- **Request limits**: An overall number of requests you can perform within the current API contract term.\n    \n- **Record limits**: The number of records you are entitled to retrieve within the current API contract term.\n    \n\nYou can track usage status using the [Usage Lookup endpoint](#ec3704c0-8898-4ba7-baf4-c45b46ef80d3).\n\nYou can also track usage using the response headers of each API call (with the exception of the Authentication and Lookup endpoints).\n\n| Parameter | Sample Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| X-RateLimit-Limit | 1500 | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per minute |\n| X-RateLimit-Remaining | 999 | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window |\n| X-RateLimit-Reset | 1583161964 | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) |\n| X-Usage-Record-Limit-Limit | 10000000 | The maximum number of records you can retrieve within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Record-Limit-Remaining | 878530 | The remaining number of records you can retrieve within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Request-Limit-Limit | 10000000 | The maximum number of requests you can make within the current API contract term.

			"description": "The ZoomInfo API authenticates client access requests using a JSON Web Token (JWT). A JWT is a string that is generated by the server for the client that can then be passed along in an HTTPS request.\n\n**Note**: The Authenticate endpoint is one method for authenticating with the ZoomInfo API with a username and password. For other methods that utilize public libraries for Java, Python, and NodeJS, see the 'Authentication methods' section in the [ZoomInfo API introduction](#intro).\n\nTo obtain the token, the client exchanges valid user credentials with the server which generates the token and provides it back to the client.

Use [Contact Enrich Outputs](#28b47784-3186-4fc4-af91-12e6bc6fb31a) to retrieve the list of available output fields.\n\n**Input combinations**\n\nTo match a contact, you must use one of the following combinations of parameters to construct your input:\n\n- `personId` OR `emailAddress` OR `hashedEmail` OR `phone`. Because these values are unique to a single person, you can use any one of these values to search without providing any additional parameters. You can optionally combine one of these values with a `companyId`/`companyName`.\n    \n- `firstName` AND `lastName` AND `companyId`/`companyName`. Combining these values effectively results in a unique person.\n    \n- `fullName` AND `companyId`/`companyName`. Combining these values effectively results in a unique person.\n    \n\n**Maximum inputs per request**\n\nYou can input a maximum of 25 contacts in a single enrich request, returning the equivalent number of matching records. See the endpoint examples for how to build queries using multiple inputs.\n\n**Required fields**\n\nYou can specify a list of required fields for each record returned. This supports all output fields and can be used as a comma-separated list.

See the endpoint examples for how to build queries using multiple inputs.\n\n**Declaring desired output**\n\nYou must explicitly list the desired output fields in your request. For example, a simple request might look like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"matchCompanyInput\": [\n        {\n            \"address\": {\n                \"zi_c_street\": \"805 Broadway St\",\n                \"zi_c_state\": \"Washington\",\n                \"zi_c_city\": \"Vancouver\",\n                \"zi_c_zip\": \"98660\",\n                \"zi_c_country\": \"United States\"\n            },\n            \"phone\": {\n                \"zi_c_phone\": \"+1 3607836800\",\n                \"zi_c_country\": \"United States\"\n            },\n            \"zi_c_location_id\": 2079041960,\n            \"zi_c_url\": \"zoomInfo.com\",\n            \"zi_c_name\": \"zoomInfo\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"outputFields\": [\n        \"zi_c_location_id\",\n        \"zi_es_ecid\",\n        \"zi_es_location_id\",\n        \"zi_c_is_hq\",\n        \"zi_c_tier_grade\",\n        \"zi_c_name\",\n        \"zi_c_name_display\",\n        \"zi_c_legal_entity_type\",\n        \"zi_c_url\",\n        \"zi_c_street\",\n        \"zi_c_street_2\",\n        \"zi_c_city\",\n        \"zi_c_state\",\n        \"zi_c_zip\",\n        \"zi_c_country\"\n   ]\n}\n\n ```\n\nTo keep the response data clean and unambiguous, if there is no data for a requested field, or it is NULL/EMPTY, the API will not return the field in the response.\n\n**Response status codes and error handling**\n\nThis endpoint supports up to 25 inputs per request and will return a HTTP status code in the response indicating a 200, 400 or 5xx status.\n\n| Code | Meaning |\n| --- | --- |\n| 200 | Request inputs are acceptable. The API can return a successful match or no match. |\n| 400 | Indicates an error in the request input. |\n| 5xx | Indicates a server-side error. Retry the request or contact ZoomInfo Support if the issue persists. |\n\nWhen a request includes multiple companies, the following will occur:\n\n- If at least 1 input succeeds in a request containing multiple inputs (up to the limit of 25), a 200 HTTP status code will be returned.\n- If none of the inputs succeed and the request includes only a combination of bad inputs and internal errors, the API will return a 400 HTTP status code.\n- If all inputs fail due to a server-side error, the response body of all of the input will return a status code of 500.\n    \n\n**Input params**\n\nSee the examples for how to structure your request. You must explicitly list the desired output fields in your request.

										"description": "Use this endpoint to update an existing webhook, including its enabled status, target URL, and subscription details.\n\nSpecify the webhook by appending the webhook `id` in the request URL. For example:\n\n`https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/213786430`\n\nWhen using the Update Webhook endpoint, values you provide in the JSON body of your request overwrite values in the existing webhook. Common scenarios for using this endpoint include the following.\n\n**Enable a webhook**\n\nAs described in the [Create Webhook](#6cbb2c08-cb50-4b15-9a01-a2d0d3dabaa1) endpoint, we recommend initially configuring a new webhook as disabled so you can ensure the target URL is reachable, and the verification token is in place in your integrated app. Once these tasks are complete, you can use the Update Webhook endpoint to enable the webhook.\n\nFor example, send a request specifying the webhook `id` in the URL to change the `enabled` value to `true`:\n\nRequest URL:\n\n`https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`\n\nJSON body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"enabled\": true\n}\n\n```\n\n**Update webhook subscription details**\n\nExample: Your webhook has a subscription with the `objectType` set to `Company`, you can change it to `Contact` using the Update Webhook endpoint.\n\nRequest URL:\n\n`https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`\n\nJSON body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"subscriptions\": [\n        {\n            \"subscriptionId\": \"393093719\",\n            \"eventType\": \"Update\",\n            \"objectType\": \"Contact\"\n        }\n    ]\n} \n\n```\n\n**Add a new objectType to a subscription**\n\nExample: Your webhook has a subscription that includes only the `Contact` `objectType`. You can add the `Company` `objectType` to the subscription.\n\nRequest URL:\n\n`https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`\n\nJSON body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"subscriptions\": [\n        {\n            \"eventType\": \"Update\",\n            \"objectType\": \"Company\"\n        }\n    ]\n} \n\n```\n\n**Delete a subscription**\n\nYou can delete a subscription by simply sending the `subscriptionId` in your request without specifying any subscription parameters.\n\nRequest URL:\n\n`https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`\n\nJSON body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"subscriptions\": [\n        {\n            \"subscriptionId\": \"836880237\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n```\n\n**Input params**\n\n| Parameter | DataType | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| title | String | Title for the webhook |\n| enabled | Boolean | Enable or disable the webhook |\n| targetUrl | String | Destination URL for the webhook data.

							"description": "ZoomInfo data is highly dynamic, with contacts, companies and related data being constantly updated in real-time in our database. Naturally, our clients want these changes to be delivered in real-time for the records they've already purchased using the ZoomInfo API - that's where webhooks come in.\n\n## Why webhooks?\n\nOrganizations with ZoomInfo API access use the API's endpoints to search for, export, and enrich records to their integrated applications. While you can regularly poll for updates to contact and company records you've already enriched using the API, manually querying the entire database is not the best use of your time. A more efficient method is to configure webhooks to automatically update you when there is a change to a record you’ve purchased. Once configured, Webhooks will listen for events you subscribe to and automatically send over all (or only relevant) updates securely to your application.\n\n## Monitoring API/Webhooks basics\n\nAvailable to organizations with the Scaling API, the Monitoring API is a set of endpoints that allows for the configuration of webhooks subscriptions that specify:\n\n- **Webhook Title**: Name of the webhook.\n- **Subscription**: The events you are listening for, consisting of object types and event types.\n    - **Object types**: The types of records you want to update. Supported object types are Contact and Company.\n    - **Event types**: The events that trigger a webhook's response. Currently, the only supported event is Update.\n- **Changed attributes**: This is a JSON object that includes a list of fields that are changed as part of a payload.\n- **Payload types (full payload/changed attributes only)**:\n    - A full payload (all fields for a contact or company, including changed attributes)\n    - Only the changed attributes for a contact or company.\n- **Target URL**: The target URL to which the webhook JSON payloads are sent.\n- **Verification Token**: Signature token that will be part of the request we send to you.\n    \n\n## Securing the data transfer\n\nTo secure communication between ZoomInfo and your app, a _verification token_ is generated when you create the webhook. When data is sent to your target URL using a POST request, this verification token will be included in the request header (_x-zoominfo-token_) and can be used in your app to authorize receipt of the data from ZoomInfo.\n\nThe initial token is generated when you create a webhook. To maintain security for your webhook over time, you can periodically generate a new verification token using the [Generate Verification Token](#9cc75e99-622e-4aa2-b9a8-2d33d0ede2ed) webhook.\n\n## Considerations\n\nNote the following considerations:\n\n- To use the Monitoring API/webhooks, you must have access to the Scaling API.\n- To subscribe to events, you must have already enriched at least one contact or company record using the API.\n- You will only receive updates on records that you've purchased using the API within the past 12 months.\n- The default payload type for company or contact updates is the full payload with changed attributes.\n    \n- The maximum number of profiles delivered in a single webhook payload is 25.\n    \n\n## Payload examples\n\nHere are examples of the POST requests your webhook's target URL will receive.\n\nFor contact and company records, you can choose to receive a full payload of all possible fields for a record (including changed attributes), or a payload including only the changed attributes for a record.\n\nIn either case (full or changed attributes only), contact and company records will always include the following fields to support mapping the profile:\n\n**Contacts**: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`\n\n**Companies**: `id`, `name`, and `website`\n\nThe following examples are provided below:\n\n- Example 1: Contact record - full profile (default)\n- Example 2: Contact record - changed attributes only\n- Example 3: Company record - full profile (default)\n- Example 4: Company record - changed attributes only\n    \n\n**Example 1: Contact record - full profile (default)**  \nIncludes all output fields\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"webhookDetails\":\n  {\n    \"id\": \"xxxx\",\n    \"title\": \"webhook-title\",\n    \"objectType\": \"Contact\",\n    \"eventType\": \"Update\"\n  },\n  \"data\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1260398587,\n      \"firstName\": \"Henry\",\n      \"middleName\": \"L.\",\n      \"lastName\": \"Schuck\",\n      \"email\": \"henry.schuck@zoominfo.com\",\n      \"hasCanadianEmail\": \"false\",\n      \"phone\": \"(360) 783-6816\",\n      \"directPhoneDoNotCall\": false,\n      \"street\": \"805 Broadway St Ste 900\",\n      \"city\": \"Vancouver\",\n      \"region\": \"Washington\",\n      \"metroArea\": \"Portland\",\n      \"zipCode\": \"98660\",\n      \"state\": \"Washington\",\n      \"country\": \"United States\",\n      \"continent\": \"North America\",\n      \"personHasMoved\": \"Uncertain\",\n      \"withinEu\": false,\n      \"withinCalifornia\": true,\n      \"withinCanada\": false,\n      \"validDate\": \"01/09/2023 07:26 PM\",\n      \"lastUpdatedDate\": \"1/5/2020 7:59 PM\",\n      \"noticeProvidedDate\": \"06/27/2020\",\n      \"salutation\": \"\",\n      \"suffix\": \"\",\n      \"jobTitle\": \"Founder & Chief Executive Officer\",\n      \"jobFunction\":\n      [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Executive\",\n          \"department\": \"C-Suite\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"education\":\n      [\n        {\n          \"school\": \"University of Nevada , Las Vegas\",\n          \"educationDegree\":\n          {\n            \"degree\": \"\",\n            \"areaOfStudy\": \"\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"school\": \"Oxford University\",\n          \"educationDegree\":\n          {\n            \"degree\": \"comparative law\",\n            \"areaOfStudy\": \"\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"school\": \"The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law\",\n          \"educationDegree\":\n          {\n            \"degree\": \"\",\n            \"areaOfStudy\": \"juris doctorate degree cum laude\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"picture\": \"https://www.zoominfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/henry.png\",\n      \"techSkills\":\n      [\n        {\n          \"id\": 92113,\n          \"name\": \"Microsoft Access\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": 112883,\n          \"name\": \"Forrester\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": 31687,\n          \"name\": \"Wave\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": 68842,\n          \"name\": \"engage\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"mobile\": \"\",\n      \"personalEmail\": \"\",\n      \"mobilePhone\": \"(818) 679-4647\",\n      \"supplementalEmail\": \"henry.schuck@gmail.com\",\n      \"mobilePhoneDoNotCall\": false,\n      \"externalUrls\":\n      [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"linkedin.com\",\n          \"url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hschuck\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"twitter.com\",\n          \"url\": \"https://www.twitter.com/henrylschuck\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"contactAccuracyScore\": 94.0,\n      \"isDefunct\": false,\n      \"employmentHistory\":\n      [\n        {\n          \"jobTitle\": \"Vice President of Data and Marketing\",\n          \"managementLevel\":\n          [\n            \"VP-Level\"\n          ],\n          \"fromDate\": \"2002-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\n          \"toDate\": \"2006-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\n          \"company\":\n          {\n            \"companyId\": 0,\n            \"companyName\": \"iProfile\",\n            \"companyPhone\": \"\",\n            \"companyWebsite\": \"\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"managementLevel\":\n      [\n        \"C-Level\"\n      ],\n      \"locationCompanyId\": 344589814,\n      \"positionStartDate\": \"\",\n      \"yearsOfExperience\": \"20-29\",\n      \"company\":\n      {\n        \"division\": \"\",\n        \"id\": 344589814,\n        \"name\": \"ZoomInfo\",\n        \"descriptionList\":\n        [\n          {\n            \"description\": \"ZoomInfo was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Washington.

										"description": "With Bulk Company Enrich you can:\n\n*   Enrich up to 10K records in a single Enrich job\n*   Retrieve up to 500 results per page\n    \n\nUse this endpoint to enrich company information based on [input values](#7a915792-e8cd-4e3a-9f0e-c19b850be536) and return the desired [output fields](#d05239c3-2597-45f8-9384-f2dbd3518cfc) in the response.\n\n**Note**: All output fields in the [Company Enrich](#5fdf6e5e-f71e-4e1f-9807-0f8296094dcc) endpoint are supported, with the exception of `companyDescriptionList`.\n\nWhen you submit an enrich request, an asynchronous job is started, and a `job_id` is instantly returned. For example:\n\n```\n{\n   \"jobId\": \"e97813aa0bcae7a66f2ea9e1b69a0da2057bbfd8\"\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can use the `job_id` to check the status of the job and enrich results.\n\nSee the [Bulk Job Status](#1f6246d0-fd13-4f63-b170-dda2fedd8322) and [Bulk Job Results](#5417ba88-096d-448a-b6cd-b930089c678d) endpoints for details on how to use the `jobId` to preview and return results."

							"description": "Use the Bulk APIs to search, retrieve, and enrich large ZoomInfo company and contact datasets through asynchronous batch processes.\n\nWith 20x more records than Contact and Company Search and 400x more records than the Contact and Company Enrich, you can leverage Bulk APIs for data ingestion and enrichment at scale.\n\n**Bulk Search API**\n\nWith the Bulk Search API you can:\n\n*   Search for up to 200K records with a single search query\n*   Preview or redeem up to 500 records per page\n    \n\nTwo job types are available with the Bulk Search APIs:\n\n*   The Preview job type returns a company or contact search results preview to help identify records best suited for enrichment. Credits are not charged for the Preview job type.\n*   The Redeem job type enables data retrieval for ingestion, returning selected output fields for a given contact or company. A credit is charged for each unique record that is redeemed.\n    \n\nWhen you submit a search request, an asynchronous job is started, and a job_id is instantly returned. You can use the job_id to check the status of the job and retrieve results.\n\n**Bulk Enrich API**\n\nWith the Bulk Enrich API you can:\n\n*   Enrich up to 10K records in a single job\n*   Retrieve up to 500 results per page\n    \n\nWhen you submit an enrich request, an asynchronous job is started, and a job_id is instantly returned. You can use the job_id to check the status of the job and enrich results.\n\n**Rate Limiting**\n\n*   You can have up to 5 \"active\" jobs (Jobs that are in progress are active jobs. Once a job is completed, you can proceed to creating another job)\n*   You can create up to 1 job per second\n*   Each job you create expires after 24 hours"

			"name": "Release Notes",
			"item": [],
			"description": "ZoomInfo Enterprise APIs are updated frequently with new features and improvements. Refer to these release notes to track ongoing updates.\n\n## September 18, 2023\n\nIf your organization has access to the WebSights API, we've added a new output field called `confidenceScore` to the data that can be returned for a company.\n\n- Confidence Score indicates the certainty of an IP matching a domain.\n- The score ranges from 0.00 to 1.00.\n- Only matches with a score of 0.3 or above are shown by default.  \n    Contact your Account Manager for lower-scoring matches. It could be empty.\n    \n\n## August 15, 2023\n\nWhen using the Contact Search API, you can specify that direct phone (`directPhone`) in `requiredFields` to only return contacts that have the direct phone numbers. Use the `requiredFields` input parameter to specify a list of required fields for each record returned. This can include: `email`, `phone` (direct or company), `directPhone`, `mobilePhone`, `personalEmail`. You can include a comma-separated list of these fields.\n\n## June 19, 2023\n\n### Monitoring API Update: Support for `changedAttributes`\n\nWe have updated the Monitoring API to support `changedAttributes`. This feature indicates what information has been changed in a webhook payload for Contact and Company. For example, it can specify details such as \"email and Job title changed for Joe Smith\".\n\n## March 16, 2023\n\n### Bulk APIs `sortBy` Feature Issue Resolved\n\nWe have fixed an issue that was causing the `sortBy` feature in Bulk Contact Search APIs to fail. Users can now sort data without experiencing any issues.\n\n## March 14, 2023\n\n### Documentation Update: New API Bundles\n\nWe have updated our documentation to reflect new bundle organization. The bundles have been restructured as follows:\n\n- The Bulk APIs and Webhooks/Monitoring API are now exclusively part of Scaling APIs.\n- The Standard APIs remain as they are - realtime Search and Enrich APIs.\n    \n\n## February 14, 2023\n\n### Updates to Alexa Rank and Introduction of Domain Rank in Company Enrich APIs\n\nWe've made some changes to our Company Enrich APIs regarding website popularity metrics:\n\n- The `alexaRank` field is now deprecated. Previously, this field provided a measure of website popularity, ranking millions of websites in order of popularity based on data from Alexa.\n- We've introduced a new field, `domainRank`, powered by SimilarWeb. Domain Rank is calculated based on an algorithm determining a site's monthly web traffic. The lower the `domainRank` number, the higher the site's rank. This will provide more accurate and comprehensive data about a website's performance. Please use `domainRank` for your future needs.\n    \n\n## February 1, 2023\n\n### Performance Improvements to Bulk APIs\n\nWe've made a number of performance improvements to our Bulk APIs. These enhancements aim to provide faster responses and improved efficiency when handling large data sets.\n\n## January 19, 2023\n\n### New Feature\n\n**Location Enrich API**\n\nLocation Enrich now supports two new output fields.\n\n`\"locationEmployeeCount\" : 2342` This indicates the number of employees at a physical location of a company.\n\n`\"locationName\" : Wholefoods Boston` This indicates the name of the company at this physical location, this can include names of subsidiaries/child/acquired companies\n\n## December 5, 2022\n\n### New Feature\n\n**Contact Search API**\n\nYou can now sort contact search results by their Accuracy Score (`\"sortBy\": \"contactAccuracyScore\"`).
